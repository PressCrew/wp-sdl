In the meantime you can\r\ngenerate them yourself my running `phpdoc` in the root folder.\r\n\r\n### How stable is this library?\r\n\r\nThe code is pretty solid, but looking for early adopters to test and provide feedback.\r\n\r\n### I need help, found a bug, need a feature!\r\n\r\nPlease visit the [issues section](https://github.com/PressCrew/wp-sdl/issues).\r\nNice, polite people get a lot more love and attention than snarky whiners :)\r\n\r\n### Who's behind this thing?\r\n\r\nI am [Marshall Sorenson](https://github.com/MrMaz),\r\nco-founder of [Press Crew](https://github.com/PressCrew).\r\n\r\nMany thanks go to [Boone Gorges](https://github.com/boonebgorges) and\r\n[Bowe Frankema](https://github.com/BoweFrankema) for feedback and encouragement.","name":"WP-SDL","tagline":"WordPress Standard Developer's Library","google":""}
