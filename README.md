## The WordPress Standard Developer's Library

WP-SDL is a set of helper classes which handle mundane WordPress programming
tasks like form field generation and other nasties.

### Is this thing for me?

If you are a WordPress theme or plugin developer, then yes!

### Why did you create this library?

There is so much overlapping "grunt" code in my WordPress projects,
that I couldn't take it anymore!

### Why should I trust this library in *my* projects?

* Small code signature.
* 100% PHPDoc coverage.
* 100% PHPUnit coverage.
* Baked in backwards compatibility.
* Baked in *concurrent* compatibility.

### Where are the docs?

Currently looking in to hosting them with GitHub pages. In the meantime you can
generate them yourself my running `phpdoc` in the root folder.

### How stable is this library?

The code is pretty solid, but looking for early adopters to test and provide feedback.

### I need help, found a bug, need a feature!

Nice, polite people get a lot more love and attention than snarky whiners :)
